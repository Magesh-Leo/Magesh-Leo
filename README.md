  I'm Magesh, a passionate web developer from Chennai, India, specializing in web development and design. I enjoy designing and coding, focusing on writing clean, understandable, and testable code 👨🏼‍💻. Collaborating with a team is something I truly enjoy.
  <br /><br />
  In my free time, I like to cook and explore new recipes. When I'm not cooking, I indulge in watching movies, particularly Kollywood movies and series, although I don't have a specific favorite.
  <br /><br />
  I have a casual demeanor and believe in treating everyone as fellow human beings, regardless of their socio-political or economic status. Equality is a core value for me, advocating for equal treatment based on gender, race, sexuality, religion, caste, and any other factors. I believe in valuing individuals equally, irrespective of their circumstances.
  <br /><br />
  Apart from all these interests, I genuinely enjoy engaging in conversations with people. So feel free to reach out and slide into my DMs!
